# Library_Management_System_with_C

PASSWORD ADMIN:       libpass
PASSWORD LIBRARY:     libpass

A library management system using C program functions has been developed as a console application without graphics. The system allows for book-related operations such as adding,
 returning, issuing, and deleting records of books issued, as well as searching for books. File handling has been extensively used in the project for almost all functions. The user interface 
of the system has been created using basic C functions to generate menus, show message boxes, and print text on the screen. Customized text with colors and fonts can be displayed using 
functions that fetch the exact video memory addresses of a target location to write text at a particular location.

We hereby declare that the project entitled “Library_Management_System” submitted for the Bachelor of Technology (CSE) degree is my original work and the project has not formed 
the basis for the award of any other degree, diploma, fellowship or any other similar titles.
